#### Summary

This assignment explores linear regression, logistic regression, and GAM for the churn dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data. I analyze model performance and assumptions. The best model was GAM which recorded a 80% accuracy, Logistic Regression was 79% accuracy. Both of these models gave good results. Linear Regression performed significantly worse with 29% accuracy. Full discussion is within the Jupytr notebook.
